He will have to learn, I know, that all men are not just, 
all men are not true, but teach him also that for every 
scoundrel there is a hero; that for every selfish 
politician, there is a dedicated leader.
.. Teach him that 
for every enemy there is a friend.
It will take time, I know, but teach him, if you can, that 
a dollar earned is of far more value than five 
found...Teach him to learn to lose...and also to enjoy 
winning. Steer him away from envy, if you 
can, teach 
him the secret of quiet laughter. Let him learn early that 
the bullies are the easiest to lick...Teach him, if you can, the wonder of a 
book...but also give him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the 
sky, bees in the sun, and f
lowers on a green hillside.
In school, teach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat...Teach him to 
have faith in his own ideas, even if everyone tells him they are wrong...Teach 
him to be gentle with gentle people, and tough with the tough. Try
 to give my 
son the strength not to follow the crowd when everyone is getting on the 
bandwagon...Teach him to listen to all men...but teach him also to filter all he 
hears on a screen of truth, and take only the good that comes through.
Teach him, if you c
an, how to laugh when he is sad...Teach him there is no shame 
in tears. Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much 
sweetness...Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders, but 
never to put a price tag on his heart and soul. Tea
ch him to close his ears to a 
howling mob...and to stand and fight if he thinks he is right.
Treat him gently, but do not coddle him, because only the test of fire makes fine 
steel. Let him have the courage to be impatient...let him have the patience to b
e 
brave. Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will 
always have sublime faith in mankind.
This is a big order, but see what you can do...He is such a fine little fellow, my 
son!
